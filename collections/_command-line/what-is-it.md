The fundamental way of issuing a command to the the computer is by typing it on
the _command line_.

Interfaces (like point-and-click graphical interfaces, or audio commands, or
even games controllers) bypass the command line because they are more
convenient. But when you study computer science, you go to the machine: you
must get familiar with the command line.

The _commands_ your computer understands vary depending on what kind of
computer it is (of course!) but the fundamentals of commands are the same.
