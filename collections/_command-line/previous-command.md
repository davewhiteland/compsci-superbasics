Also known as: the "history".

<span class="key"><em>↑</em></span> and  <span class="key"><em>↓</em></span>

Most command line interpreters remember the commands you've entered. You can
get them back by pressing the up-arrow key. Keep pressing the up-arrow to get
back previous commands — they aren't executed, of course, until you press
enter. Press down-arrow to come back through the history.

Don't waste time typing in long commands when you can just tap up-arrow a few
times to recall them.

<span class="key"><em><sub>ctrl</sub></em></span><span
class="key"><em>R</em></span>

Unix systems also support "history search", which is another fast way to recall
commands you've already issued. Press Ctrl+R, then start typing the string to
match... then press Ctrl+R again to cycle through the matches. To execute that
command (you can edit it first), press enter. If you don't want to execute it,
press Ctrl+C (or down-arrow back out of history) to get back to your prompt.
