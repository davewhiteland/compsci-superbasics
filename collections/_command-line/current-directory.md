Also known as: Where you are.

It is often _critically important_ that you know where you are when you issue a
command. This is why the  prompt is often set to show the current directory. Or
use `pwd` to find out.

See the superbasics on the file system for more information:

* The [special name `.`]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/special-filenames)
  _always_ refers to the current directory.

* Understand [the current directory]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/current-directory)
  in terms of navigating the file system.

* use the `cd` ("change directory") command to
  [move around]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/moving-around) the file system â€” this
  is how you control where you are.
