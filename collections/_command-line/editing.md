Although it varies a little depending on which command shell you're using, you
can [recall previous commands]({{site.baseurl}}/command-line/previous-command)
and then edit them before pressing enter.

You sometimes need to use a [modifier key]({{site.baseurl}}keyboard/modifier-keys)
to get specific behaviour.

| Press this... | ...to do this                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">A</span> | jump to start of line |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">E</span>| jump to end of line    |
| <span class="key">←</span> and <span class="key">→</span> | run both ways along the line   |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">←</span>   | jump left one whole word             |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">→</span>   | jump right one whole word            |


On the Mac, in _Terminal_, if you hold down the option key <span
class="key"><sub>⌥</sub></span> you can click with the mouse on a character on
the command line and the cursor will jump to that position on the line.

Also on the Mac, use the <span class="key"><sub>⌥</sub></span> key (instead of
control) with the arrows to jump between words.
