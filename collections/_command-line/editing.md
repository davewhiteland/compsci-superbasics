Although it varies a little depending on which command shell you're using, you
can [recall previous commands]({{site.baseurl}}/command-line/previous-command)
and then edit them before pressing enter.

| Press this... | ...to do this                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| <span class="key"><em><sub>ctrl</sub></em></span><span class="key"><em>A</em></span> | jump to start of line |
| <span class="key"><em><sub>ctrl</sub></em></span><span class="key"><em>E</em></span>| jump to end of line    |
| <span class="key"><em>←</em></span> and <span class="key"><em>→</em></span> | run both ways along the line   |

On the Mac, in _Terminal_, if you hold down _option_ <span
class="key"><em><sub>⌥</sub></em></span> and click with the mouse on a character on
the line, the cursor will jump to that position on the line.
