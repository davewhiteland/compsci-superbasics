You're familiar with the desktop because it's what you see when you log into
your computer with a graphical user interface. 

But in terms of a file system, it's just another directory (usually called
`desktop`). The only thing that's special about it is that it's the one
that is displayed on your whole screen when you use a window-based interface.

This means you can — of course — still access the files on your desktop via
the command line.

In most systems you'll find the `desktop` directory inside your
_home directory_. Your home directory is the one associated with your username,
and which is normally set to be the current directory when you log in. On Unix
systems, this has the [special name]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/special-filenames)
of `~` (tilde, or twiddle).
