* Why are files called _files_?
* Can files contain other files? Is that what a zip file is?
* Can a file be empty?
* Can a file's name be the empty string?
* A file is generally the unit of organised data on a storage device. So... is
  an SMS message on your phone a file? If not, what is it? That is, how else
  can things like messages be stored?
* How can the _same picture_ of a cat be in `cat.gif`, `cat.png`, and
  `cat.jpg`? What's the difference between them? Which one is "best"?
* If you can make a file smaller by zipping it, why don't we just zip all files
  again and again, until they are all... tiny?
* What happens when you delete a file? What does _securely_ deleting a file
  really mean?
* Are symbolic links (sometimes called "aliases") files?
* Can you delete the directory that you are currently in?
* Is it possible to accidentally delete _all the files_ on your computer?
* If a filename doesn't have an [extension]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/extensions),
  how can you find out what kind of file it is? What tools are available to
  help you? How do they work?
