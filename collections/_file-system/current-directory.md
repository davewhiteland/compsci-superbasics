Also known as: "this directory" or "current working directory"

When you are navigating the file system the concept of _which directory you are
in_ is very important, especially when you are working on the
[command line]({{ site.baseurl }}/command-line).

This matters because when you refer to files, by default the computer will
assume you're refering to files relative to where you are.

**Find out which directory you are in**

The `pwd` command (pwd is short for "print working directory") tells you
where you are.

    pwd


**Change directory**

To change directory
`cd`
