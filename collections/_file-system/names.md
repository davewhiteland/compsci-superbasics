Every file has a name. These are examples of file names:

    data.txt
    names.html
    assignment-1.py
    Experiment_12_a
    CAT.GIF
    letter.2020-12-03.docx

The filename must be unique in the
[directory]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/directories) it's inside.
You cannot have two files with the same name within the same directory.

You can give files almost any name you want... but it's a good idea to only
use letters and numbers (and maybe hyphen and underscore: `-` and `_`).

It's inconvenient to work with files with spaces or other punctuation in them.

Filenames in Unix systems are case-sensitive, so it's a good idea to simply
keep all your filenames lower-case (unless there's a specific reason not to).

The filename is _only_ a name: it in no way affects what is in the file.
