Also known as: "the directory above".

The parent of _any directory_ has the
[special name]({{ site.baseurl}}/files/special-filenames) `..` (two dots).

This is useful because you can include it in file paths without needing to 
explicitly know the name of the parent.

The path to the file `notes.txt` in the parent directory is:

    ../notes.txt

You can apply this more than once. The path to the file `average.py` in a
directory three directories _above_ your 
[current directory]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/current-directory) is:

    ../../../average.py
