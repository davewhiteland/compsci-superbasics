These are basic skills you should be able to do with your text editor.

Whatever text editor you decide to use, you _must_ learn to do these things
efficiently.

If you're programming, you are going to spend a lot of time editing source
code. Using the menus for basic functions like these will be much too 
cumbersome.  There will be keyboard shortcuts for them: learn them!

Keyboard shortcuts might differ for different programs, but often there
are similarities (for example, Control-Z for **undo** is common).

### Save file

Many programs auto-save for you, but that's less common in text editors. So
make sure you know how to save the file after you've changed it.

### Navigation

Moving around the file is usually done with the arrow keys (or clicking
with the mouse). But you can often scroll up and down by whole pages too,
or jump to the next word, or either end of the line.

### Jump to line

When you have an error in your program, it's very common to know what line
number it's on. You must be able to quickly and reliably jump to a specified
line. It's also handy if you can see what column you're on too: most text
editors show this somewhere in the interface.

### Find

Searching for a string in the file is very useful. Be aware if you are searching
case-sensitively (`yes` is not the same as `Yes` or `YES`).

> Most editors support **regular expressions** which are a powerful way to
> describe _patterns_ of text. If you learn regular expressions, they will
> be very useful (both for searching text, and programming).

### Find and replace

Related to _Find_, it's often useful to be able to find text and then replace
it.

### Indent

It's surprisingly common to need to indent (or un-indent) blocks of text, and
many text editors support this.

### Undo/redo

It's common to be able to undo your work if you make any mistakes. 

Programmers use version control systems for a more sophisticated way of handling
this, but you will also find undo to be useful.

### Cut and paste

Cut (or copy) and paste text to move it around. You'll need to be able to
select it first (if you're using a mouse, click and drag is common).

Some text editors support dragging as a quicker method of moving selected text
without passing it through the paste buffer.

### Show invisibles

When you are programming, sometimes invisible characters can catch you out:
these include non-printable characters, spaces and tabs. If they are part of a
string, they can look identical to strings that _are not the same_. Editors
often allow you to display invisible characters so you can see if this is
happening.
