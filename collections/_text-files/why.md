The text file is an extraordinarily versatile file format. It is accessible
to both humans and computers:

* text files are human-readable
* reading and writing text files is straightforward in most programming languages
* the differences between text files can be meaningful
* ...this means changes in text files can be managed too (version control)
* you can use the same tools on them (editors, searching, transforming)
* they can be useful for transferring content _between_ applications (for example,
  when exporting data out of an application so it can be read by another)
* the position of any character within a text file can be addressed (line:column)

Text files are so ubiquitous you _must_ be familiar with how to work with them.
In particular, this means developing good
[text editing]({{ site.baseurl }}/text-files/editors) skills.
