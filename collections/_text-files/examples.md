The following are all examples of text files (with their common
[file extensions]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/extensions)):

| type of text file           |  file extension             |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| plain text                  | `.txt`                      |
| HTML                        | `.html`                     |
| Python                      | `.py`                       |
| Java source code            | `.java`                     |
| markdown                    | `.md`                       |
| Javascript                  | `.js`                       |
| comma separated values      | `.csv`                      |
| numerical data              | `.dat`                      |
| JSON format data            | `.json`                     |
| SVG image                   | `.svg`                      |

The important thing is not that they contain text (words and sentences) but
that they are _encoded as text_.

> Remember that the [file extension]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/extensions) is

The following are all examples of files which are _not_ text files
(they are sometimes called [binary files]({{ site.baseurl }}/text-files/binary-files)):

| type of binary file         |  file extension             |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Word document               | `.doc`, `.docx`             |
| Zip archive                 | `.zip`                      |
| PDF                         | `.pdf`                      |
| Image                       | `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.png`      |
| Audio                       | `.mp4`                      |
| Excel spreadsheet           | `.xls`                      |
