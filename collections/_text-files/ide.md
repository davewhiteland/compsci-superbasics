An Interactive Development Environment (IDE) is used to write programs.

Since most¹ programs are written in text (source code), and stored as text files,
an IDE always includes a text editor. 

In fact, some IDEs are little more than  text editors that "know" about the
language you are working in. Others are much more sophisticated and include
tools for debugging, compiling, testing, building and reformatting your code.

By definition, IDEs can provide _language-specific_ features in addition to
the text-editing features. This is why IDEs are so useful for programmers.

> Often you're free to pick one you like — many are free. Experiment with
> different IDEs but as soon as you've settled on one **learn to use it**.

Common features of IDEs include:

* **syntax colouring**

  The IDE can colour keywords, variable names, literals (basically, different
  types of thing in your program) differently. This helps you read your code
  more quickly, but is also useful for spotting errors.

* **error highlighting**

  The IDE may also be able to indicate mistakes (including, but not limited to,
  syntax errors) as you are typing.

* **auto-formatting**

  Some IDEs provide auto-formatting tools that layout your code neatly,
  according to standards for the language (which you can often override).

* **auto-suggest**, **auto-complete**

  IDEs often provide tools to help you enter program code (often you use the
  tab key to accept suggestions). This is useful both for speed and also for
  avoiding typing errors. Basic IDEs do this with the keywords of the
  programming language you're working in. But more poweful IDEs also offer the
  variable and method names you've declared in your program.

* **commenting**

  It's common to be able to select a some code and _comment it out_. This
  works because the IDE knows how to indicate a comment in the language you're
  working in. If the IDE has this feature, you'll also be able to un-comment
  too.

  programming environments that do _not_ use text editors.
