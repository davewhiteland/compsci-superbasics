There are effectively two ways devices can be connected: wirelessly, or by
cable. Each has different characteristics of capacity (what kind of data can be
sent, and how fast) and range (over what physical distance).

It's usually possible to identify the kind of cable by looking at the physical
connection (or the socket).

### Video Cables

Video cables join computers to [monitors]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/monitors).

Common types are:

* DVI
* HDMI
* DisplayPort
* VGA (Video Graphics Array)  
  VGA is somewhat out of date now, but you might come across monitors that
  still require it (if you need to connect a VGA device to a different
  port, you'll need an [adaptor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/dongles)).
