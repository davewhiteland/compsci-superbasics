There are effectively two ways devices can be connected: wirelessly, or by cable. There are different ways each of these can work, and each has different characteristics of capacity (how much data can be sent, and how fast) and range (over what physical distance).

### Network cables

The most common kind of network cable is the _ethernet cable_.



### Video Cables

Video cables join computers to [monitors]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/monitors).

Common types are:

* DVI
* HDMI
* DisplayPort
* VGA (Video Graphics Array)  
  VGA is somewhat out of date now, but you might come across monitors that
  still require it (if you need to connect a VGA device to a different
  port, you'll need an [adaptor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/dongles)).

### Optic fibres
