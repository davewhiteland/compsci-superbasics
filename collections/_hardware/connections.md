There are effectively two ways devices can be connected: wirelessly, or by
cable. Each has different characteristics of capacity (what kind of data can be
sent, and how fast) and range (over what physical distance).

It's usually possible to identify the kind of cable by looking at the physical
connection (or the socket).

**Ethernet cable**  
Connects your computer to a network if, for example, you don't have
WiFi.

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-hdmi.svg)

**HDMI cable**  
Connects your computer to a
[monitor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/monitors).


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-micro-usb.svg)

**Micro USB**  
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-mini-usb.svg)

**Mini USB**  
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-usb-3.svg)

**USB 3**  
The most recent USB connector that physically fits in the earlier
USB A â€” the blue indicates that data speed/protocols are different.

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-usb-a.svg)

**USB A**  
The first of the USB connectors to be introduced; still widely used.
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-usb-b.svg)

**USB B**  
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-usb-c.svg)

**USB C**  
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-serial.svg)

**Serial port**  
Connects your computer to a _serial port_ for sending one character at a time,
which is sometimes used for low-level communication between devices. The stalks
are threaded so you can twiddle them to tighten the connection so it won't fall
out.

### Video Cables

Video cables join computers to [monitors]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/monitors).

Common types are:

* DVI
* HDMI
* DisplayPort
* VGA (Video Graphics Array)  
  VGA is somewhat out of date now, but you might come across monitors that
  still require it (if you need to connect a VGA device to a different
  port, you'll need an [adaptor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/dongles)).


### What about optic fibres?

Fast networks connections are often implemented by transmitting light along
optic fibres (instead of electric signals over along wires). But it's rare for
this to be a connection on your own computer, unless your computer is a server.
Metal wires are cheaper and more robust than fibres, so are commonly used for
local connections.
