There are effectively two ways devices can be connected: wirelessly, or by
cable. Each has different characteristics of capacity (what kind of data can be
sent, and how fast) and range (over what physical distance).

It's usually possible to identify the kind of cable by looking at the physical
connection (or the socket).

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-ethernet.svg)

**Ethernet cable**  
Connects your computer to a network if, for example, you don't have
WiFi.


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-usb-a.svg)

**USB A**  
The first of the USB connectors to be introduced; still widely used.
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-micro-usb.svg)

**Micro USB**  
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-mini-usb.svg)

**Mini USB**  
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-usb-3.svg)

**USB 3**  
The most recent USB connector that physically fits in the earlier
USB A â€” the blue indicates that data speed/protocols are different.

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-usb-b.svg)

**USB B**  
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-usb-c.svg)

**USB C**  
Connects your computer to another device with
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb).


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-lightning.svg)

**Lightning**  
Connects your Apple computer to another device with a lightning cable. This is
very similar to USB&nbsp;C except it's only implemented on Apple devices.


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-hdmi.svg)

**HDMI cable**  
Connects your computer to a
[monitor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/monitors).


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-dvi.svg)

**DVI**  
Connects your computer to a
[monitor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/monitors).
DVI connections often have stalks you can twiddle so you can tighten the
connection.


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-display-port.svg)

**Display Port (DP)**  
Connects your computer to a
[monitor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/monitors).


![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-vga.svg)

**VGA**  
Connects your computer to a
[monitor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/monitors).
VGA is mostly found on old devices, and the cable uses a D-shaped connector
with 15 pins or holes ("D-15"). Like other D connectors, the stalks are
threaded so you can tighten the connection.

![cable]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cable-serial.svg)

**Serial port**  
Connects your computer to a _serial port_ for sending one character at a time,
which is used for low-level communication between devices. You don't find therse
on consumer-level devices any more but you might still use them in labs or
robotics applications. The stalks on these "D" connectors are threaded so you
can twiddle them to protect the pins from bending and to tighten the
connection.

### What about optic fibres?

Fast networks connections are often implemented by transmitting light along
optic fibres (instead of electric signals over along wires). But it's rare for
this to be a connection on your own computer, unless your computer is a server.
Metal wires are cheaper and more robust than fibres, so are commonly used for
local connections.
