Keyboards are effectively grids of switches that make connections in a
circuit when the keys are pressed. If there's no electricity, pressing a key
won't do anything. So keyboards need power. If your keyboard isn't working,
check it's either connected, or has batteries that aren't empty.

There are three types of physical keyboard:

### Keyboard connected by a cable

The cable provides a route for the power supply, and the signals indicating
which keys you've pressed. Keyboards that connect using
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb) are common.

If your computer uses a dedicated keyboard port, by convention it will be
coloured purple. 

> If your cable keyboard isn't working, check that the cable is connected
> _at both ends_. 

### Wireless keyboard

This must have a its own power (typically AA or AAA,  batteries).
Some keyboards have a small light indicating that the power is on, and
sometimes there is a small switch too.

The power supply of a wireless keyboard drives the transmission of data to the
computer (typically using [Bluetooth]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/wifi-and-bluetooth)).
When the batteries start to run out, the signal will be weaker, and the range
will decrease until it can no longer connect.

> If your wireless keyboard isn't working, check that it is switched on, and
> that it has batteries that have not run out. You might require a
> [dongle]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/dongles) to be connected to the
> computer.

   
### Laptop keyboard

A laptop's keyboard is integral to the machine, so it is directly connected
to the power.

It is possible to connect other types of keyboard to a laptop too. If you do
this, _both_ keyboards may be active, so be careful not to accidentally press
keys on the one you are not using.
