_USB_ (Universal Serial Bus) is the dominant standard for connecting small
devices. It's helpful because it allows different types of device — almost
anything that you might want to connect to a computer — to use the same port.

There are several different kinds of USB port (they've changed over time), so
you need to check the
[type of connector]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/connections).
The most recent is type C, but type A is still very common. You can use an
[adaptor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/dongles) to convert between them.

A major benefit of using USB is that different devices can use the same
physical connections. Of course this means the size and layout of the the ports
(that is, the socket and the plug) are precisely defined. But USB can only work
because it is a thorough specification of protocols defining how the devices at
each end of the cable must communicate with each other.

The USB specification covers both the transfer of signals (data) _and_ power.
This is why low-power devices (such as keyboards or drawing tablets, for
example) that are connected by USB don't need a separate power cable. The
convenience of using a single type of connector to charge mobile phones has
resulted in the European Union proposing legislation to force manufacturers to
adopt USB&nbsp;C as the standard.
