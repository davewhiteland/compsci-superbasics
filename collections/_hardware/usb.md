USB (Universal Serial Bus) is the dominant standard for connecting small
devices. It's helpful because it allows different types of device — almost
anything that you might want to connect to a computer — to use the same port.

There are several differnt kinds of USB port (they've changed over time),
so you need to check what shape and size the hole is.

The most recent is type C, but type A and B are still common too. You can use
an [adaptor]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/dongles) to convert between them.

In practice, the primary benefit of USB is that different devices can use the
same physical hole. Of course this means the size and layout of the the ports
(that is, the socket and the plug) are precisely defined. But USB can only
work because it is a thorough specification of protocols defining how each
device connects to each other.

If you see a USB symbol on a device or its connector, you know that it will fit in a USB socket, and also the that device has been certified
to comply with the USB standards (so your computer should be able to
communicate with it).

The USB specification covers both the transfer of signals (data) _and_ power.
This is why low-power devices (such as keyboards or drawing tablets, for
example) that are connected by USB don't need a separate power cable. Most
mobile phones are charged by USB now because of the convenience of using only
a single socket.

USB-C data transfer can be fast. But USB is a short-range technology, and not suitable for covering long distances.
