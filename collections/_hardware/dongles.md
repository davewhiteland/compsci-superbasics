A dongle is a small physical device that connects to a computer port,
either to provide an additional function, or to allow signal conversion.

There are many different uses for dongles. For example:

* a security key that provides authentication that is external
  to the computer (such as a personal license)

* an adaptor that lets you plug a cable of the "wrong" type into a different
  kind of connection<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
  (an ethernet to USB C converter, for example, or an HDMI-to-VGA adaptor)

* a dongle that provides wireless connection, such as that needed by
  a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard, or to Wifi

* a means of transforming signals or data by sitting between the port
  and the external device, such as gaming cheat codes or network packet
  sniffers


<p class="footnote"><sup id="footnote-1">1</sup>
Even simple adaptors might be more sophisticated than you realise. An adaptor
is almost never simply joining matching pins (wires) together. It may often
contain embedded software that converts between the different protocols in
order to make the signals they pass through make sense.
