Your computer requires power to run. All personal computers run off the mains
electricity supply (in the UK, this is 230V AC), so you need to plug in to that.

The UK plugs have three pins and are very stable (they don't wobble out).

On most computers today, you need at least two power cables: one for the
computer, and one for each monitor.

Smaller devices might get power from other cables: 
[USB]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/usb) and
[lightning connectors]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/connections)
can both supply power (there will be a transformer on that cable too, if it's
plugged directly into the mains power).

## Batteries

Laptops, tablets, and phones all contain batteries that are charged by being
connected to the mains supply (either via a transformer, or via another device
such as a USB connection from another powered device).

The charging profile of different types of batteries can affect the optimal
pattern to use when recharging them. For example, avoid exposing Lithium ion
batteries to high temperatures (this can permanently reduce their ability to
retain charge). If you want to maximise the lifetime of the battery in your
laptop computer, check the recommendations from that particular manufacturer
and model.
