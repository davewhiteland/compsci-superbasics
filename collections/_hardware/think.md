* Why is silicon used to make chips?  
  What is it about semiconductors that has allowed for the manufacture of
  integrated circuits? Are there other metals we can use?
* Why do computers need fans? What is generating the heat?
* Are there _liquid cooled computers_?
* Spilling liquid (oops! coffee!) on hardware can ruin it. Why?  
  What remedies should you attempt?
* Can power be transferred wirelessly, like data?
* How do RFID chips work if they don't have a power supply?
* Is it possible to build a computer that doesn't use electricity?
* How might a villain go about reading the data that is being sent along a cable
  without having access to the port at either end?
* Since chips have no moving parts, they can't wear out and must remain
  functional _forever_. Right?
