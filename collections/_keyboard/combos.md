Some keys are _modifier_ keys: they change the meaning of the other key you
press. A clear example of this is how you use the shift (⇧) key to type the
lower and upper case letter A:

| keys pressed               | result            |
| -------------------------: | ----------------- |
| <span class="key"><em>A</em></span> | a                 |
| <span class="key"><em>&nbsp;⇧&nbsp;</em></span><span class="key"><em>A</em></span> | A  |

Both "a" and "A" are printable characters — good for typing words. But other
modifiers can indicate that you're not trying to _type_ the letter "a" at all,
but using it as a button to have some effect. You are sending a control signal.

<div class="not-too-wide">
<object id="svg-key-animation" data="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/keys-a-shift-a-ctrl-a.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
</div>

For example, if you are pressing the control key when you hit the A, it might
mean "select **A**ll the things". The specific meaning will vary depending on
what program is currently running, and what it's listening for. To help you
remember, programs tend to use the same conventions for what the key
combinations mean.

You can only do combinations with modifier keys. Pressing more than one
ordinary key at the same time (for example, A and B) generally does not work.
