<span class="wide key"><sub>enter</sub></span>

Sometimes the enter key does not say "enter" on it but shows a down-and-back
arrow like this:

<img class="enter-key" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/key-enter.svg">

The enter key is often used to indicate the end of _submitting input_. You
might already be used to using it to mean "go" or "send". See more about
[using enter on the command line]({{ site.baseurl }}/command-line/using-enter) .

In word processors or text editors the enter key indicates a new line — this is
really from the days of "carriage-return and new line" from typewriters. This
legacy still exists in the _line-ending_ characters stored in text files (which
are different between Windows and Unix). It's why the enter key is sometimes
called the return key too.

The enter key is often used to _confirm_ a program or process — often it will
close a dialogue box just as if you had clicked OK.
