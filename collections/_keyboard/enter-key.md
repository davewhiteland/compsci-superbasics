<span class="wide key"><em><sub>enter</sub></em></span>

Sometimes the enter key does not say "enter" on it but shows a down-and-back
arrow like this:

<img class="enter-key" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/key-enter.svg">

The enter key is often used to indicate the end of _submitting input_. You
might already be used to using it to mean "go" or "send". See more about
[using enter on the command line]({{ site.baseurl }}/command-line/using-enter) .

In word processors or text editors the enter key indicates a new line — this is
really from the days of "carriage-return and new line" from typewriters. This
legacy still exists in the [line-ending]({{ site.baseurl }}/text-files/newlines)
characters stored in [text files]({{ site.baseurl }}/text-files/contents) (which
are different between Windows and Unix). It's why the enter key is sometimes
called the _return key_ too.

The enter key is often used to _confirm_ a program or process — often it will
close a dialogue box just as if you had clicked OK.
