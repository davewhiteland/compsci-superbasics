Learn to touch type! That means: you should _actively_ practice so you can type
without looking at the keyboard.

If you're writing programs, you're going to be doing a _lot_ of typing, and you
want to be able to do that as efficiently as possible.

If you "hunt and peck" for each of your keys, everything will take longer. More
to the point, all the time you spend looking at the keyboard is time you are not
looking at the screen to see what you are actually doing.

On a QWERTY keyboard, the "home" keys are `F` and `J` â€” these are the middle of
the keyboard. If you rest your hands so your index fingers are there, you can
and should learn where the other keys are relative to that position. Ideally,
use different fingers for the different keys.

<div class="center">
  <span class="faint key"><em>D</em></span>
  <span class="key"><em>F</em></span>
  <span class="faint key"><em>G</em></span>
  <span class="faint key"><em>H</em></span>
  <span class="key"><em>J</em></span>
  <span class="faint key"><em>K</em></span>
</div>


On most keyboards, the home keys have little bobbles on them so _you can
**feel** when your hands are in the right position_. When you're typing
correctly, your thumbs can operate the space bar (that's why it is a bar along
the bottom of the original typewriters).
