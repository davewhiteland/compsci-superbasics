* Why is the shift button called "shift"?
* Why is the space button so much bigger? Do _you_ press it with your thumb?
* All your keys are debounced on the electrical level...
* ...but actually you _could_ debounce your buttons on (say) your webforms (no
  human can _mean_ to press "pay" within 500ms of the last time, right? Are you
  checking for that?)
* Why do the keys have CAPITAL letters on them when most of the time you're getting lower case?
* What's a key-logger?
* What's a Dvorak keyboard?
* In JavaScript in your browser... can you detect when the left and right shift
  keys are pressed â€” and tell which is which?
* What about the number pad numbers versus numbers from the "regular" number
  keys?
