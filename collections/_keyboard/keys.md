You're going to do a lot of typing in your computer science degree. Here's what
you should know about about
[your keyboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/hardware/keyboards).

The keyboard is really a grid of switches, and when you hold a switch down, a
circuit closes. If you hold different keys down together, different things can
happen. This is configurable, that is, when you are an expert user you can (and
maybe should?) change what keys do what.

What you actually mean when you press a key depends on what that key is.
