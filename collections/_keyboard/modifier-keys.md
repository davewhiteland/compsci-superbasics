The modifier keys let you to use the keyboard to produce more possible signals
than there are keys. Just as the shift key lets you use 26 keys (a–z) to
produce 2×26=52 characters (a–z _and_ A—Z), so the other modifiers let you send
a lot of different signals. Modifier keys can be combined (for example, shift
*and* control *and* A).

The meanings of modifier keys can be mapped to _anything_, but here are the
conventional uses. The _symbol_ shows you how these usually appear in
documentation. Some keys can be written in more than one way (for example, the
Control key may be "Control", "Ctrl", "Ctl" or sometimes "^").

| key      | name      | symbol  | typical use               |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| <span class="key"><em>&nbsp;⇧&nbsp;</em></span> | shift    | ⇧       | shift to upper case                        |
| <span class="key"><em><sub>alt</sub></em></span> | alt      | Alt <br>⌥ <br> Option  | generate alternate character (e.g., £ or #)    |
| <span class="key"><em><sub>ctrl</sub></em></span>   | control  | Ctl <br> Ctrl <br> ^ | turn the other key(s) into a control signal   |
| <span class="key"><em><sub>fn</sub></em></span>  | function | Fn      | turn the other key(s) into a [function]({{ site.baseurl }}/keyboard/function-keys) |
| <img class="key" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/key-windows.svg" alt="the windows key">  | Windows  | Win  <br> ⊞  | specific actions — see more about the [Windows key]({{ site.baseurl }}/keyboard/windows-key)   |
| <span class="key"><em>⌘</em></span>   | command  | Cmd <br> ⌘       | execute shortcut (on Mac only) |

If you see ctrl+shift+C (or ctrl-shift-C), that means "hold down the control
key and the shift key and then press C". Those first two are modifying the C.
What that _actually_ does will depend on the program that is listening to it.
