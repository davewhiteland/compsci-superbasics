<span class="wide key"><sub>tab</sub></span>

The tab key is sometimes marked with an arrow-to-line symbol:

<img class="key" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/key-tab.svg">
<img class="key" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/key-tab-mac.svg">

The tab (tabulate) key is commonly used in three different ways, depending on
context:

* to jump to the next column (for lining up tabular data)
* to jump to the _next_ position in a form
* to autocomplete the current word (e.g., command or filename)

Normal computer users probably don't use the tab key very much. But if you're
working on the command line, you should use it **a lot**: see 
[tab completion]({{ site.baseurl }}/command-line/tab-completion/).
