These are _generally_ used in computing — but you should understand that when
you press a key, what you are really doing is sending a signal to the program
that is listening ("has the focus"), and it's up to that program to decide how
to respond. That's why Ctrl-C can mean copy _or_ interrupt... it depends on
which program is listening.

| keys     | what it usually does               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">C</span> | copy <br>cancel or interrupt |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">X</span> | cut |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">V</span> | paste |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">S</span> | save |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">F</span> | find or search |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">A</span> | select all |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">Z</span> | exit |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">D</span> | terminate input |

Specifically, these combinations are common in Unix and Windows systems.

On the Mac, many applications use the <span class="key">⌘</span> command
modifier key instead (except inside Terminal, or other Unix-like applications).
