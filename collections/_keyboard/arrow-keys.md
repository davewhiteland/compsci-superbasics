The arrow keys are used in some programs for navigating.

But the up and down arrows are also used in the command line to go up and down
through the
[history of your previous commands]({{ site.baseurl }}/command-line/previous-command/).
Go up for previous commands, down for subsequent ones.

This means you don't have to keep typing the same command in again and again.

You can use the horizontal arrows (left and right) to move along the line once
you've found it, in order to edit it before pressing enter.

Some keyboards have arrow keys on the
[number pad]({{ site.baseurl }}/keyboard/number-lock/).
