The function keys are found at the top of the keyboard. They usually have two
purposes:

* a software function (F1, F2, etc.) that depends on the current application
* a "hard-wired" effect such as controlling volume or brightness

The software function is like sending a control signal to the
current application with a _single_ keypress (that is, without needing a
[modifier key]({{ site.baseurl}}/keyboard/modifier-keys)).

Some keyboards have a function lock (fn lock) that toggles the
function keys' behaviour between software or hard-wired.

You may also be able to use the function key <span class="key">fn</span>
as a modifier key to choose the _other_ behaviour.

Function keys can be used together with a modifier key.

### Common Windows functions

Microsoft Windows has specific uses for the function keys. The actual action —
if any — will depend on which application is running (has the focus) when you
press the function key. These are some of the more useful conventions.
