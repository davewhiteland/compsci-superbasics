title: About CompSci superbasics
layout: topic

---

This little website came about in response to some beginner Computer Science
students arriving with little or no experience of using their computers on a
system level. Some come to college already having hacked their own distro of
Ubuntu, but others might never have typed a command in their lives. That's OK:
they didn't need to. Until now.

Specifically, using browser-based learning means some competent autodidacts have
learned to program entirely on the web (I'm looking at you 
[codeskulptor](https://py3.codeskulptor.org)). Nothing wrong with this — on the
contrary, it's amazing — but it means assumptions colleges make about students'
tech exposure are much less reliable than they used to be.

The problem was exacerbated by 2020's Covid lockdowns: if you're not
_physically_ in the labs seeing what other people are doing, some of this
practical knowledge is even harder to acquire, especially if you do not (yet)
have the vocabulary to search for it.

So here's somewhere we can give a student a link to if they are unfamiliar
with some of the basics that some courses take as a baseline.

CompSci superbasics was originally built for the Foundation Programming
(python) course run by the
[department of Computer Science](http://cs.rhul.ac.uk/)
at
[Royal Holloway, University of London](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk).
It went live January 2021.

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website
(designed to run nicely on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com)) —
the [whole repo](https://github.com/davewhiteland/compsci-superbasics)
is available under the MIT license.

It's currently a work in progress. More topics coming as time allows.
